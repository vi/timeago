# timeago
In Rust, format Duration into string like "1 hour ago" or "01hou".

Currently it does not [take the calendar into account](https://github.com/vi/timeago/issues/12) and assumes each month is about 30.4 days long.

Parsing such string back to a `Duration` is out of scope for this crate. Maybe see the [`chrono-english`](https://docs.rs/chrono-english) crate instead.

Older versions of the crate supported Rust from version 1.24 (with `isolang` feature off).

## API

[Documentation link](https://docs.rs/timeago/)

Simplified API excerpt (pseudocode):

```rust
pub struct Formatter<L : Language = English>{...}

impl Formatter {
    pub fn new() -> Formatter<English>;
    pub fn with_language(l: Language) -> Self;
    pub fn num_items(&mut self, x: usize) -> &mut Self;
    pub fn max_unit(&mut self, x: TimeUnit) -> &mut Self;
    pub fn min_unit(&mut self, x: TimeUnit) -> &mut Self;
    pub fn too_low(&mut self, x: &'static str) -> &mut Self;
    pub fn too_high(&mut self, x: &'static str) -> &mut Self;
    pub fn max_duration(&mut self, x: Duration) -> &mut Self;
    pub fn ago(&mut self, x: &'static str) -> &mut Self;
    
    pub fn convert(&self, d: Duration) -> String;
    pub fn convert_chrono(&self, from: chrono::DateTime, to: chrono::DateTime) -> String;
}

pub fn from_isolang(x : isolang::Language) -> Option<Box<Language>>;

pub fn format_5chars(d: Duration) -> String;
```

A `Language` can be constructed from [isolang::Language](https://docs.rs/isolang/1/isolang/enum.Language.html).

## Tool

There is a helper command line tool that allows easier experimenting when adding a new translation:

```
